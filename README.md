### Who are we?
PART is an organization at Purdue that aims to compete in the international SUAS competition annually. 
Our mission is to mature students into principled industry leaders for their post-undergraduate careers by executing a comprehensive industry standard approach to interdisciplinary design, prototyping, and systems engineering.

### SUAS Competition Overview
The SUAS competition requires students to design, integrate, report on, and demonstrate a UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) capable of autonomous flight and navigation, remote sensing via onboard payload sensors, and execution of a specific set of tasks. 
Hence, Purdue's team has a Software division, in charge of tasks such as telemmetry, transmission, mapping waypoints, and other tasks requiring software usage.
